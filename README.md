E-Dalali Backend API (Laravel)
üè† Project Overview
This repository contains the robust backend API for the E-Dalali property management and listing application. It is built using Laravel (PHP framework) and leverages a MySQL database.

The API provides secure Authentication using Laravel Sanctum (or similar JWT implementation) and the core resources for managing property listings, ensuring role-based access for different user types (owners/Customers).
